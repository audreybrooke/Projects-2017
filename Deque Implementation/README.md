LLDeque is an implementation of a Deque using a linked list. (C++)

DistanceCounter uses the deque to keep tract of the distance between two people.
A file as in example.txt is used as input and describes the steps person 1 and 2
take in given directions (North, South, East or West).
The program parses this file into the deque to calculate the location of the people.
Then, it iterates through the deque to determine how far the people are from eachother.
