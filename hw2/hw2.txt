Problem 3
---------

The returned list is a reverse of the original.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This happens because the last node is "saved" as aka
pointed to by out after the while loop in funcA.
Then, the call to funcB reverses the list starting at out.
So out is saved as the end of the original list, but
becomes the begining of the reverse list. funcB is able to
reverse the list since it returns a Node pointer which allows
it to save the value of "in" when the function call starts
and add that to the list after the previous node's location
which is returned from the next call to funcB. Thus, by
starting at the end of the list (determined by the if statement)
and traversing back up, funcB is able to recall all the values
in reverse order and add them back to the list.
