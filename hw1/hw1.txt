Problem 2
 
Part (a):  
   1. no
   2. no
   3. yes
   4. no
   5. no
   
Part (b):
   1. yes
   2. no
   3. yes
   
Part (c): ****
   1. git add hw1q2b.cpp
   2. git log

Part (d):
   prints "Aborting the commit due to empty commit message."
   So, the staged files are not commited because there was
   no commit message, which is not optional
   
Part (e): ****
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "abrooke@usc.edu"


Problem 4
   1. output is 15. 15 is the result because it is the sum of all
   the prime factors of 180. In this case, 180 was divisible by 2, 2,
   3, 3, and 5, which add to 15.

   2. funcA(n) always terminates because any number is divisible by
   atleast itself, and the else case causes the "i" (aka the number
   that "n" is divided by) to increase until the size of n. Once
   this happens, the if case returns n. If a number is divisible
   by something other than itself, the else case will increase i
   until that number is found then repeat until n is only divisible
   by itself, or 1, in which case the earlier portion holds true and
   the function will eventually terminate.

   3. The code checks if "n", which starts
   at 180 is divisible by i, which starts as 2. If so, it divides
   by i and tries again. If it is not divisible by i, it searches
   for the next number which n is divisible by by increasing i
   until n is divisible by i or i reaches the same size as n. Then
   the code recursively adds all the prime numbers it was able to
   divide n by to get
