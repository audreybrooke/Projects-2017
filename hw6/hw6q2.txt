Answer to Homework 6 Question 2 Part c

Runtime of mergesort as a function of k and n

Runtime when k=n
   When k=n there is an individual subgroup made for each
   value of myArray, thus mSort immediately breaks the array
   into ints individual parts, so merge has to sort all elements
   at once by comparing them against eachother
