Learning.cpp contains another findLearning function which finds the
permutations instead of combinations. The main is set up to use
the combinations version right now.

Doublet: instructions say the problem is case-insensitive and does
not specify which case the output words should be in so,
they output all lowercase, even if a letter was uppercase in the
input file.
